      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I am a passionate and motivated entry-level developer with a strong foundation in Data Science and Web Development. With expertise in Python, Flask, Django, and the MERN stack, I enjoy building scalable and efficient solutions for real-world problems.

I have worked on multiple projects, ranging from full-stack web applications to data-driven analytics, honing my problem-solving skills and technical abilities. My keen interest in machine learning, backend development, and cloud computing drives me to continuously learn and grow in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and engaging in tech communities. Outside of work, I have a deep interest in reading, music, and travelling.
